#{product.fullname} Import Data
=======================================

Files placed into this directory are accessible using file URLs (`file:///`)
with the `LOAD CSV` clause in Cypher. If the location of this directory needs
to be changed, this can be achieved by altering the database configuration
property `dbms.security.load_csv_file_url_root`.
