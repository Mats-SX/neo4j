[abstract]
`LOAD CSV` is used to import data from CSV files.
Supports resources compressed with `gzip`, `Deflate`, as well as `ZIP` archives.

The URL of the CSV file is specified by using `FROM` followed by an arbitrary expression evaluating to the URL in question.
It is required to specify an identifier for the CSV data using `AS`.

See the examples below for further details.
